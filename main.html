	<h1> The Concepts Of Time Complexity and Space Complexity </h1>
	<!--  
	<p>Time Complexity: The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an efficient algorithm to run as 
		a function of the length of the input.
	</p>
	-->
	<p>Time Complexity: efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity of O(n)</b></p>
<!-- 
Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result
		while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by
		the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>space complexity</b> of the algorithm.
		 For example, a sorting algorithm that takes O(n log n) time and O(1) space is faster and uses 
		less memory than a 
		sorting algorithm that takes O(n^2) time and O(n) space.</p>-->
